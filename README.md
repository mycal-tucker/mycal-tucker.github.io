# mycal-tucker.github.io

[Mycal Tucker's](http://mycal-tucker.github.io) personal website, generated
using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), based on initial code from http://wngreene.github.io

Because this site uses custom Jekyll plugins, GitHub pages cannot generate it
automatically. The workaround is to commit the site output to the `master`
branch. The source code for the site is on the `dev` branch.
